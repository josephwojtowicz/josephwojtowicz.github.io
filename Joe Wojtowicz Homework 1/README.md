# Homework 1
In this homework assignment I cleaned up the code for the Horiseon SEO website we
were provided. Doing this entailed renaming several of the div tags throughout the
body of the document which are highlighted in comments I added to the HTML. Also,
alt tags were added to the images on the website.

It was also important to rename the ```<div class="header">``` and ```<div class="footer">```
to ```<header>``` and ```<footer>```, as these tags look simpler and provide the same function.

Of course, I also renamed the title of the website to be more relevant than "website".
